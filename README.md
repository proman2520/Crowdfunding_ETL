In this repo, you will find the following: the Resources folder containing the 4 .csv exported files and 
two Excel files provided by starter code, the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql which includes our SQL code for 
loading the data into the SQL Database, this README, the Project2_QuickDBD which illustrates the schema 
made, and ETL_Mini_Project_AProzorovsky_MBuie_MDabkowski.ipynb which includes the code used for the ET 
part of the ETL.

Code assistance was provided by Eli and the TAs. The three of us pulled our weight and worked well 
together and equitably. Thank you for grading our project and please let us know of any problems 
with our code.

Best,
Group 3
